• Key Techniques: GARCH, ARIMA, LSTM, feature engineering, time series regression.
• Dataset: Yahoo Finance API or Kaggle - Historical Stock Prices - Provides detailed
historical stock prices and trading volumes, which can be used to calculate and
predict volatility indices like VIX.
• Outcome: A predictive model that estimates market volatility, aiding traders and
investors in risk management.

2. AA - volatility checks based on difference (high-low, open-close)
    a. do this on different intervals (hour, day, week, month)
3. PCA?
4. Outlier detection
5. Statistical summaries (mean, median, min, max, standard dev)
6. Temporal difference (ACF and CCF)
7. Heatmaps of intraday volatility by day/time
